###Flight Data Analysis**

#### **1. Calculate the Average Delay in Departures for Delayed Flights**

SELECT AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, scheduled_departure, actual_departure)) AS avg_delay
FROM FLIGHTS
WHERE actual_departure > scheduled_departure;
```

#### **2. List Flights Grouped by Aircraft to See Usage Frequency**
```sql
SELECT aircraft_code, COUNT(*) AS flight_count
FROM FLIGHTS
GROUP BY aircraft_code;
```

#### **3. Calculate Total Revenue per Flight**
```sql
SELECT flight_id, SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM TICKET_FLIGHTS
GROUP BY flight_id;
```

#### **4. Analyze Boarding Numbers per Flight**
```sql
SELECT flight_id, AVG(boarding_no) AS avg_boarding_number
FROM BOARDING_PASSES
GROUP BY flight_id;
```

#### **5. Determine Occupancy and Fare Conditions per Aircraft**
```sql
SELECT f.aircraft_code, COUNT(b.boarding_no) AS occupied_seats, s.total_seats,
       (COUNT(b.boarding_no) / s.total_seats) * 100 AS occupancy_rate, s.fare_conditions
FROM FLIGHTS f
JOIN SEATS s ON f.aircraft_code = s.aircraft_code
LEFT JOIN BOARDING_PASSES b ON f.flight_id = b.flight_id
GROUP BY f.aircraft_code, s.fare_conditions;
```

#### **6. Top 3 Flights by Revenue**
```sql
SELECT flight_id, SUM(amount) AS total_revenue
FROM TICKET_FLIGHTS
GROUP BY flight_id
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 3;
```

#### **7. Average Flight Duration by Aircraft Model**
```sql
SELECT aircraft_code, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, scheduled_departure, actual_arrival)) AS avg_flight_duration
FROM FLIGHTS
GROUP BY aircraft_code;
```

#### **8. Flight Count per Airport (Departure and Arrival)**
```sql
SELECT departure_airport, COUNT(*) AS departure_count
FROM FLIGHTS
GROUP BY departure_airport;
```
```sql
SELECT arrival_airport, COUNT(*) AS arrival_count
FROM FLIGHTS
GROUP BY arrival_airport;
```

#### **9. Daily Booking Trends**
```sql
SELECT DATE(book_date) AS booking_date, COUNT(*) AS total_bookings, SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM BOOKINGS
GROUP BY booking_date
ORDER BY booking_date;
```

#### **10. Frequent Routes Analysis**
```sql
SELECT departure_airport, arrival_airport, COUNT(*) AS route_count
FROM FLIGHTS
GROUP BY departure_airport, arrival_airport
ORDER BY route_count DESC;
```

#### **11. Passenger Boarding Summary per Flight**
```sql
SELECT flight_id, COUNT(boarding_no) AS total_boarded
FROM BOARDING_PASSES
GROUP BY flight_id;
```

#### **12. Average Boarding Number per Flight**
```sql
SELECT flight_id, AVG(boarding_no) AS avg_boarding_no
FROM BOARDING_PASSES
GROUP BY flight_id;
```

#### **13. Seat Occupancy Rate per Flight**
```sql
SELECT f.flight_id, COUNT(b.boarding_no) AS occupied_seats, s.total_seats,
       (COUNT(b.boarding_no) / s.total_seats) * 100 AS occupancy_rate
FROM FLIGHTS f
JOIN SEATS s ON f.aircraft_code = s.aircraft_code
LEFT JOIN BOARDING_PASSES b ON f.flight_id = b.flight_id
GROUP BY f.flight_id, s.total_seats;
```

#### **14. Total Spend per Passenger**
```sql
SELECT t.passenger_id, SUM(tf.amount) AS total_spent
FROM TICKETS t
JOIN TICKET_FLIGHTS tf ON t.ticket_no = tf.ticket_no
GROUP BY t.passenger_id;
```
